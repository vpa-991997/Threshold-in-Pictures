# This program helps to understand about Edge Detection using Sobel algorithm

## Sobel Algorithm
When using a Sobel Edge Detector, we need to prepare the image with Grayscale color. Then from there, we will apply kernel convolution as shown below:
This is the filter that we will be implementing for an edge detection.

## How to run:
1. Go to cmd
2. Compile the code : cd <dir> Assignment1.c
3. Output will give 3 output pictures including:
  - The magnitude image
  - Output with High Threshold
  - Output with Low Theshold
